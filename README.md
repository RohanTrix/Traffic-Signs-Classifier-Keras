# Traffic-Signals-Classifier
#### Trained a Deep Learning Model that can identify between 43 different German Traffic Signs using LeNet architecture. 
The dataset is available [here](https://bitbucket.org/jadslim/german-traffic-signs)
**This model has been trained to achieve an accuracy of 98.11%**

### *The dataset is sclassified into 43 different classes:*
0. Speed limit (20km/h)
*
*
*
31. Wild animals crossing 
34. Turn Left Ahead
*
*
42. End of no passing by vehicles over 3.5 metric tons

### Requirements:
**Use Google Collab to run the Code**
*Google Collab makes it easy to run various libraries in your code without the need for installing each of them separately*

### These are the libraries I have used for this project:
* numpy
* matplotlib
* OpenCV
* tensorflow
* Keras
* Pickle
* Random
* Pandas
* Requests
* Pillow

### Instructions
1. Run every cell from the notebook.
2. You can train your model with your own dataset from another source.
3. You can use different testing images 
4. Feel free to fine-tune the model for even better accuracy
5. You can use a differnt method for preprocessing image data.
